#1)
#a. the "while" loop will perform or stop performing an action when a condition becomes True. For example

Counter = 0         #first we set up our condition, here it's dependent on the integer variable 'Counter'
while Counter < 15: #ie while Counter's value is less than 15, print Counter's value during each iteration
    print Counter
    Counter += 1    # the += just means to add 1 to Counter's value during each iteration

#b. be careful because if your condition isnt met, these loops will go on infinitly, like below.
#Uncomment (alt+4) the loop below and run it to see what I mean. To manually stop a script, press cntrl + C
##Counter = 16         
##while Counter > 15: 
##    print Counter
##    Counter += 1
